# Terraform AWS Cloud Infrastructure Automation
![Project Image](./terraform-project.png)
## Description

This **Terraform project** automates the provisioning of a comprehensive AWS cloud infrastructure. The created infrastructure includes setting up VPC, Internet Gateways, Routes, Subnets, and Security Groups. In addition to these networking components, the configuration scripts in this project automatically attach an Elastic IP to the network interface. 

The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the quick and efficient deployment of an Ubuntu server, subsequently setting up Apache2 on it. This end-to-end automation ensures a streamlined and error-free setup, significantly reducing the manual effort involved in configuring each component separately.
